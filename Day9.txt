-> OOPS 

    -> Object Oriented Programming

    -> OOPS: We structure programs using Data and Behaviour(Objects)

    -> To work with OOPS Style we need an understanding of

        -> classes

        -> Objects

        -> methods

        -> Inheritance

        -> Encapsulation

        -> Abstraction

        -> Polymorphism

-> Any thing can in real world can be considered as Object

    -> Laptop
    -> TV
    -> Phone
    -> Pen 
    -> etc

-> Every Object has Data and Behaviour (Objects)

    -> Laptop

        -> Data (Characteristics)

            -> Laptop Brand = string
            -> Laptop Price = double
            -> Laptop Weight = double / int
            -> Laptop 4k Display = boolean
            -> etc

        -> Behaviour (Actions) (do)

            ->Laptop can play video
            ->Laptop can play audio
            ->Laptop can read file
            ->Laptop can take picture


-> Class:

    -> Class is a blueprint for creating Objects

    -> Class will have what Data (Characteristics - variables) and Behaviour (actions - methods)

    -> Laptop (Class)

        -> Apple Object
            -> Laptop Brand = Apple
            -> Laptop Price = 100000
            -> Laptop Weight = 1.2
            -> Laptop 4k Display = true
            -> etc

            ->Apple Laptop can play video (4k)
            ->Apple Laptop can play audio (25watts)
            ->Apple Laptop can read file (in 2 sec)
            ->Apple Laptop can take snap (12MP)

        -> Dell Object
            -> Laptop Brand = Dell
            -> Laptop Price = 65000
            -> Laptop Weight = 2.5
            -> Laptop 4k Display = false
            -> etc

        -> Behaviour (Actions) (do)

            ->Laptop can play video
            ->Laptop can play audio
            ->Laptop can read file
            ->Laptop can take picture

-> Methods 

    -> Behaviour (actions)

    -> A method is block of code that performs some task.

-> variables

    -> Repreents data (memory location)

    -> Types of variables

        -> Instance variables

            -> Created inside the class and outside the methods without static keywords

            -> Instance : Object of an classes

            -> Instance Variables : Variables asociated with Objects

            -> Memory is allocated when object is created

            -> Can have default values, if not initialized

            -> Stored in Heap Memory / Area 

        -> Local variables

            -> Created inside the methods and blocks / constructors

            -> Used for temporary calculations

            -> Once execution is completed, value become obsolete.(removed)

            -> Variables should be declaread and initialized.

        -> Static Variables(Global / Class)
            
            -> Created inside the class and outside the method, with static keywords

            -> Static variables belongs to class not objects.

            -> Used for static/fixed values (Common data)

            -> Variables should be declared and initialized.

            -> To access static variables we use Classname.variable
