-> We Write code: Instruction what task to perform 

-> Compilation: Convert source code to intermediate Byte Code.
    
    -> Synatx: Rules / Gudilines
        -> Every java file must start with (Class, Interface ,enum , or record expected).
            
            -> Class is must for begineer level
            -> Proper method declaration should be given (main method is starting point of a program)
            -> main method declaration:
                public static void main(String[] args){

                }

                -> Public : access modifiers (visibility control)
                -> static : keyword that says no need of object to perform an operation.
                -> void : Keyword that says we will not return anything(void means nothing).
                -> String : data type for text kind of data.
                -> [] : Array data.
                -> args : arguments.

            -> ; indicates end of the statement.

            -> text data in java is represented as " "
            
            -> NOTE: If You want to print in java then you the following syntax.
                    System.out.println("Welcome"); 

    -> javac (java compiler):  Utility / tool which is a part of JDK installation.
    
    -> To perform compilation: javac App.java
    
        -> After Compilation : App.class (Byte code).
    
    -> java (jvm java virtual machine will be involved) is the command we use to interpret byte code.

        -> Syntax: java Classname 

    -> Any programming 
                                                                    javac       no issues
