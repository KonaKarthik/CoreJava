-> Output 
    -> Concatination
        -> Strings (Joining multiple strings ) we use + operator 
        -> Strings with the other datatypes.

-> Manipulate Data (If Required)

-> Operators
    -> Special Symbols, Perform operations on variables and values.

    -> Operators Classifications

        1) Arithmetic Operators 
            -> Used to perform mathematical calculations.
            -> + - * / %
        
        2) Increment / Decrement Operators
            -> Mostly used in the Looping statements.
            -> Update(increase) a value by 1 called as increment ++
            -> Update(decrease) a value by 1 called as decrement --

        3) Compound Assignment Operators
            -> = Assignment operator
                > Combining Arithmetic and assignment 
                > Used to concise code (short hand code)

                -> x=10
                -> x = x + 5 => 15

                -> x=10
                -> x+= 5 => 15
        4) Relational / Comparision Operators 

            -> Used to compare values
            -> Result will be boolean (true/false)

                -> == (equality)
                -> != (Not equals)
                -> > (Greater than)
                -> < (Lesser than )
                -> >= (Greater than equals)
                -> <= (Lesser than equals)
        5) Logical Operators    
            
            -> Ued to combine multiple conditions.
            -> Result will be boolean (true/false)

                    -> && (AND) : returns true , when both conditions are true
                    -> || (OR)  : return true , when either of the condition is true
                    -> !  (NOT) : negates the actual value (true -> false or false -> true) 
        TRUTH TABLE:
        X     Y      X && Y    X || Y       ! X      ! Y
        T     T         T         T          F        F  
        F     F         F         F          T        T 
        T     F         F         T          F        T 
        F     T         F         T          T        F  

        6) Bitwise Operators    
            -> Used in low level programmimg (0's and 1's)
                -> & (AND) : When both bits are 1,then result is 1
                    X          Y       x&y       x|Y
                    1          1        1         1
                    0          1        0         1
                    1          0        0         1   
                    0          0        0         0
                    
                -> | (OR) : Either one of the bits is 1 , the result is 1
                -> etc
