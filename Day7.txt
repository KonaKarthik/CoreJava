1)Control Structures / statements :
    -> In java , control statements helps you control the flow of execution.
    
    ->Control structures Categories:

        > Conditional statements (Decision making statements)
            -> if statement: Runs block of code if the condition is true.

                Syntax:
                    if(condition){
                        Statements
                    }

            -> if-else statement: Runs one block of code if condition is true, and run another block of code if condition is false.

                Syntax:
                    if(condition){
                        Statements
                    }
                    else{
                        Statements
                    }

                    ->NOTE : Ternary operator / Conditional operator , allows you to write concise form of if-else.

                        -> Syntax: variable = (condition) ? value_if_true:value_if_false

                        -> Use when assigning a value to variable based on condition.

            -> else if ladder: Used when you have multiple conditions to check.
                Syntax:
                    if(condition){
                        Statements
                    }
                    else if(condition){
                        Statements
                    }
                    else if(condition){
                        Statements
                    }
                    else if(condition){
                        Statements
                    }
                    else{
                        Statements
                    }
                 
            -> Switch statement: alternative to if-else with multiple conditions. 

                Syntax:
                    switch(expression){
                        case value1:
                            //statements
                            break;
                        case value2:
                            //statements
                            break;
                            '
                            '
                            '

                        default:
                            //Statements
                            break;
                    }
        
        > Looping statements (Iteration statements)
            
            -> Looping statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on condition.

            -> Repeatation, Automation etc.

            -> Looping Types:
                1) for loop : Used when you know number of iterations / repetations in advance.
                    ->  
                        Syntax:
                            for(initialization ; condition ; increment/decrement){
                                    statement
                            }      
                
                
                2) while loop:  Used when you don't know number of iterations / repetations in advance.
                    ->
                        Syntax:
                            initialization
                            while(condition){
                                statements
                                increament or decrement
                            }
                3) do while loop: similar to while, but runs the code at least once, before checking the condition.
                    ->
                        Syntax:
                            initialization
                            do{
                                statement 
                            }
                            while(condition);

                4) Nested loops: Loops inside loops

                    -> Tabels : rows and columns;
        
        > Branching statements (Jump statements) 

            -> break: Used inside loops, to terminate (immediately exit).(already used in switch case)

            -> continue: Used to skip current iteration.

            -> return : Used to return a value.
